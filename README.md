This project makes use of [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/) to format the pages as well as provide in-page functions. The [main repository](https://github.com/zunda/mitome.in) is configured to interact with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) so that

- the master branch is automatically deployed to https://mitome.in/
- a pull request is automatically deployed as a deploy preview. Look for the link in the pull request conversation.

## Project setup
Install yarn following their [installation instruction](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/).

Install dependent packages with

```sh
yarn install
```

## Authoring
Create and edit the `.md` files under `docs/`. Add them to the side bar to the `themeConfig.sidebar` array in `docs/.vuepress/config.js`. Please add your name and contact (optional) to the contributor list in `doc/README.md` if you would like to.

Place images under `docs/.vuepress/public/`. They are available at the base path.

### The mitomein logo and icon
Edit `assets/mitomein.svg` with Inkscape and export it as png images into `docs/.vuepress/public/`.

## Serve the pages
Previews of your edit will be available at http://localhost:8080/ with the command below running locally:

```sh
yarn docs:dev
```

The command below generates static files to be served under `./docs/.vuepress/dist/`.

```sh
yarn docs:build
```

### ERR_OSSL_EVP_UNSUPPORTED
It seems that Webpack version 4 doesn't support OpenSSL version 3 and commands like `yarn docs:dev` fail with the `ERR_OSSL_EVP_UNSUPPORTED` error. In that case, please supply the `--openssl-legacy-provider` option as `NODE_OPTIONS` environment variable, i.e.:

```sh
NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider yarn docs:dev
```
